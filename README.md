# Debtorian
A debt tracking web application made with Node.js, React.js and Express.js.

People should sign up, create a common budget, add other users to that common budget and start entering their spendings.
You join to or create common budgets and enter your spendings to them. The app's goal is to make everyone's spending equal. For example, flatmates often need to split everything like bills equally, constantly. This can be very frustrating. With this method, everyone pays as much as they can, they enter their spending and leave the calculations like who pays how much more to the app. These "common budgets" supports up to almost an infinite amount of people.
