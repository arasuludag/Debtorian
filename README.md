# Debtorian
A debt tracking web application made with Node.js, React.js and Express.js.

People should sign up, create a common budget, add other users to that common budget and start entering their spendings.
For example, flatmates often has to split bills and this can be frustrating. 
With this web app, you don't need to split. Spend, enter the amount you have spent and leave everything to the app.
